semalam busy, so tak sempat nk tulis apa2. tapi nak recap. masa balik hari jumaat tu, dah bagi hadiah auni untuk mama. mama cakap thank you sangat-sangat. but she doesn't know kita mcmni skrg. no one knows yet, cuz i still have some hope we could work. mama tanya banyak pasal auni, okay ke belajar, best ke Indonesia, mahal ke baju dia beli utk ameer tu. ada la lain-lain. dia cakap ni asyik keluar ni kahwin la cepat kalua dah mampu, tapi buat istikharah dulu. sejujurnya ameer xtau nak rasa apa. in my pov, i already tried my best, dah doa semua, but something just feels wrong. taktaula sbb life got in the way ke. decision aku utk take it slow made it worse. tapi at the same time im afraid to get closer. at this point ameer rasa ameer ada commitment issue. im distracting my emotion dgn semua kerja ni. semua event. lama tak jujur dgn diri. lama tak deep talk dgn kau. jap cane bole sampai sini

so semalam, ada pergi kenduri kahwin. pakaila baju auni bagi tu. tbh its a little big on my shoulders cuz of the sponge. but other than that i love it so much. just know i will still wear every thng kau pernah bagi aku forever. i grew up with you, you were a big part of my life. im really grateful for that. so i want to remember you always. and masa kahwin tu, adalah mak aku cite pasal kahwin2, jodoh bagai. sejujurnya aku x ingat. but it all comes back around,  istikharah. 

tu je la menarik smlm. harini ada meeting utk kerja makcik aku. esok ada test tapi ameer x start study sangat lagi. minggu ni pun akan pernuh sangat. esok test, selasa reccee kat n9, rabu ada meeting n kelas, khamis meeting multimedia, jumaat kena balik, sabtu ada pegi zoo negara ngn family pastu malamnya ada dinner. maybe benda2 ni dapat distract aku. 

ive been looking at your TikTok reposts. banyak benda kau cakap betul. i feel like i have broken you. aku pun x terfikir aku boleh buat camni kat kau. when we first got together, i never thought i would be the problem. tapi.. ameer nampak satu tu tulis, you stayed when times get hard. im sorry but, you didn't. when i was at my lowest awal tahun ni, you left me. you knew how broken i was, how much i cared about you. but you left anyways. i was left alone to fix everything. sampai mesej efi nk mintak maaf. i was willing to do everything to get you back. and i did. i crawled and begged for you to come back. and i am doing it again.

i keep asking myself. nak teruskan ke. at this point, i know i still love auni. i think kita ada banyak lagi adventure yang x buat. but my commitments.. my fears.. its just not now.. hati aku taktau nk move on lagi ke. and sejujurnya i need us to make a decision. do you still want me after what happened? kalau no, kau dah tawar hati habis, then its okay. but if you have a little hope, like i do, then im willing to try again. BUT, not now. tapi when we finally talk or meet again, we need to talk it out, maturely. i cant lose you as a friend. aku xnak us end badly. ill regret it for the rest of my life.
